🧠 NeuroGuard – Early Alzheimer’s Detection System

NeuroGuard is an AI-driven research project focused on the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using cognitive and behavioral data analysis. The system leverages machine learning to identify early signs of memory decline and generate predictive risk scores, supporting timely clinical intervention.

🔍 Overview

Alzheimer’s disease often progresses silently in its early stages. NeuroGuard aims to assist in early screening by analyzing structured cognitive assessment data and behavioral patterns using a robust gradient boosting model.
